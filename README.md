# Capstone project for first three months of NewForce

This project was built using React after learning react for only 2 weeks. It is a web client for viewing Zotero libraries (www.zotero.com) and making small edits to items or changing tags.

A working version of this project is deployed to Heroku here: https://zotero-capstone.herokuapp.com/

*WARNING*: This project was built as a student for demonstration purposes only. It may destroy or change your Zotero items in unexpected ways if used outside of my limited testing.
